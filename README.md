# UrzasResearchDesk
A web app to display and interrogate win rates and aggregate archetypes from magic the gathering.

## Dev Notes

### V1 Requirements
There is some major functionality/things to investigate before making this more widely available:

DONE
- Automated updates from MTGODecklistCache.
- Card images onhover/on the card stats page.
- Fix selection updates.

TODO
- Tooltip hover not covered by tabs.
- Lock plots in place.
- Card search on mobile.
- Archetype bundles, potentially from Badaro.
- Fix selection default info.
- Reset all selections.
- Double check interaction between selection and individual card analysis. At least say what the histogram is normalized to.
- Plotting accessibility features (colours and fill/marker styles, not just colour).
- Don't reload plots each time if possible.

### V2 Goals
- Temporal analysis.
- (Option to) Remove mirrors.
